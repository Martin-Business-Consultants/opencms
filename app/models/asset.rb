# An uploadable asset (image, file). Wraps an Active Storage attachment with
# a stable ID that gets stored as the value of `:asset` block fields.
#
# What an asset does lives in the concerns under app/models/asset/; this file
# keeps the attachment, the validations (in the order their errors are
# reported) and what it's called.
